In layman's terms, this does what Google Authenticator or Authy does. This uses a custom built pcb and a 3d case, also it uses a firmware built for this purpose using esp-idf, uses lvgl as the GUI library. The features of open authenticator's printer circuit board are: Small form factor of 82mm x 42mm Uses ESP32-WROOM-32D module Uses 128x64 0.96\" inch OLED panel Uses DS3231 RTC with battery backup (CR2032) for timekeeping Powered by 3.7V 300 mAh LiPo battery Uses MCP73831 for charging LiPo battery Uses TPS63001 Buck Boost Converter IC for efficient 3.3V power supply, with input range from 1.8V - 5.5V Uses TPS22919 Load switch to control power to OLED and RTC chip Autoselect power source, i.e., battery or USB USB Type-C for charging only (no data pins connected) Media Coverage Hackster.io: TOTP-Based Open Hardware Authenticator Powered by an ESP32 Microcontroller Gallery Project logs Hackaday: https://hackaday.io/project/176959-open-authenticator Join the Discussion: Discord: https://discord.gg/kVDdB9kAEP Repositories PCB Design: https://github.com/Open-Authenticator/hardware-design Firmware: https://github.com/Open-Authenticator/open-authenticator-app 3D-Case: https://github.com/Open-Authenticator/3d-case Ordering PCB Components Bill of Material Sponsors OSHPark - Thanks to OSHPark for sponsoring first prototype PCBWay - Thanks to PCBway for sponsoring the final prototype Asahitec - Thanks for discounts on stencil","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#overview","text":"The Open Authenticator is an open source TOTP based hardware authenticator using ESP32.
